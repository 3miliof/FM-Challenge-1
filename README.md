# FM-Challenge-1
3-column preview card component challenge from FrontendMentor.io

This is my first challenge attempted on FrontendMentor, in order to better practice and understand responsive web design.

I think the actual design was accurate to the original, and it swapped between mobile and desktop better, but the tablet sizes inbetween could maybe have been altered to appear more professionally.
